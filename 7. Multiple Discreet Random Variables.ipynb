    "## Jointly Distributed Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "random variables maps the same outcome in the sample space to different numbers are said to be jointly distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "ex: Consider an expirement of randomly picking a student, the random variables that map height and weight are called joint random variables.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "joint PMF maps the random vector (points in a plane if two joint random variables) to [0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Joint PMF follows all the properties of a normal PMF\n",
    "- $0 \\le P_{X,Y}[x_i, y_i] \\le 1$ lies between 0 and 1\n",
    "- $\\sum_{i=1}^{N_x} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_y} P_{X,Y}[x_i, y_i] = 1$ sum of probabilities of all possibilities is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marginal PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "If the joint PMF is known, then the PMF for X and the PMF for Y can be derived. These derived PMFs are called Marginal PMFs\n",
    "\n",
    "Inorder to find out the PMF of X, we iterate through each $x_i$ in all the pairs like $(x_i, y_j)$. For each $x_k$ find all tuples $(x_k, y_j)$ and sum all its probabilities\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Properties\n",
    "- Given marginal probabilites of X and Y, the PMF cannot be constructed because there are infinite joint PMFs yeilding the same marginal PMFs.\n",
    "- Marginal PMF of X is independent of Y and vice-versa, that is the probability of $y_k$ happenning regardless the outcome of X. The dependency information is lost when marginal probabilities are dervied, therefore it is impossible to build joint PMF from marginal PMFs, unless it is given that X and Y are independent.\n",

    "### Independence of Multiple Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
